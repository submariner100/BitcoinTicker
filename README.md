#  Bitcoin Ticker

## Our Goal

The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills you learned in the Clima tutorial and make a Bitcoin price reporter. We are going to revisit how to use Cocoapods, networking calls and JSON parsing. This will be the most advanced challenge you will face to date. We believe in you!

## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.

From Submariner100........

I am following along this project and reinforcing my skill set in Swift/Networking and general iOS. Each section I will commit it to Github.

There was a few surprises in this project. The first one being that Xcode did not Recognise SwiftyJSON was using Swift 5. After digging on the net and using Stackoverflow this issue was resolve quite easily. 

I fully recommend this course about programming in Swift to everybody. Its only $10 dollars on Udemy and it is called ios 12 app development bootcamp by Angela Yu.

This course will teach you about intergrating with api's and networking
